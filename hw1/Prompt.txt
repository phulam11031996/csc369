    Fill in the "Student (username)" column with your own username (one student per data store)
    Explore available documentation for your chosen data store (including reference documents, developer information, articles, etc.) with a specific focus on support for replication and partitioning.
    Write a one-page narrative summary describing replication and partitioning options supported by your chosen data store. Make sure to note the specific software version you investigate. Include citations/links to relevant documentation. Submit this to canvas. Your document should cover the following aspects (some areas may not be applicable to all data stores):
        Default Replication Mode

        Support for Multi-Leader and/or Leaderless Replication
        Leaderless Topology Support
        Default Partitioning Strategy
        Other Supported Partitioning Strategies
        Partition Rebalancing Strategies
        Index Types Supported
    Note that summaries will be shared with all students for review.
